Despite this, the Office for National Statistics has identified that the gender pay gap widened between 2007 and 2008 and women are paid on average 17.1% less per hour than men and 35.6% in the part-time sector. (CIPD January 2010) Employment claims are increasing in the area of equal pay and government measures are increasing to reduce the pay-gender gap with the introduction of equal pay audits and the new Equality Bill implementing the publishing of equal pay data.</p>
<p>Employers are ultimately responsible for ensuring that their pay systems are free from gender bias. Eden HR Consulting works with employers to enable them to deliver fair pay systems in accordance with equal pay legislation. Pay for the purposes of ‘Equal Pay’ covers a complete remuneration package including that of benefits alongside basic pay and can include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Total earnings,</li>
<li>Basic pay,</li>
<li>Non-discretionary bonuses,</li>
<li>Overtime rates and allowances,</li>
<li>Performance related benefits,</li>
<li>Bonuses,</li>
<li>Severance/redundancy pay,</li>
<li>Access to pension schemes,</li>
<li>Benefits under pension schemes,</li>
<li>Hours of work, including annual leave,</li>
<li>Company cars, sick pay, fringe benefits (e.g. travel allowances, fees to professional bodies - etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>An employee has the legal right to submit an <strong>Equal Pay Questionnaire</strong> if he/she feels that they are subject to pay disparities between a colleague of the same sex who do like work or work of like value. You are required to respond within 8 weeks to such a request. Although completion of the questionnaire is not compulsory, you should be aware that an employment tribunal may draw any such inference as is just and equitable from a failure to reply or from an evasive response. Eden can assist in ensuring your response to an Equal Pay Questionnaire is robust and has sufficient information within it. We can also suggest potential remedies and/or strategies to resolve the immediate dispute and to prevent any future inequalities.</p>
<p>Eden HR can help by explaining the legislation, discussing risk, addressing equalities in pay and also by conducting formal <strong>Equal Pay Audits.</strong></p>
