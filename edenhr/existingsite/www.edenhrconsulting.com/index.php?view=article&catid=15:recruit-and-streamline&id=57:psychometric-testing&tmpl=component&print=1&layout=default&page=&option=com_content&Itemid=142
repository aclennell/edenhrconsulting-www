<p><img height="185" width="300" src="http://www.edenhrconsulting.com/images/stories/eden-stick-figures/eden-recruit.jpg" alt="eden-recruit" style="float: right;" />Psychometrics is all about the science of predicting future behaviours. It is a highly researched science where lengthy, rigorous testings are undertaken in tightly controlled environments, in order to ensure that when the tools are used against real candidates they are valid and reliable in practice. Psychometric testing falls into two forms; ability testing and personality profiling.</p>
<p>Everyone is different, everyone has a value, everyone has special strengths and qualities, and by understanding these in the individuals you may want to recruit, or promote, or manage, is where personality profiling and ability testing can help.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Ability Testing</strong></strong></p>
<p jquery1288277518681="102">An ability test is usually a standardised test that is designed to measure the natural ability of a candidate to develop skills or acquire knowledge and estimate their future performance on tasks.  They look at the level of proficiency in some particular subject area or skill.  Examples of ability tests; verbal reasoning, abstract reasoning, numerical reasoning, spatial awareness, clerical checking, spelling, mechanical reasoning etc.</p>
<p jquery1288277518681="102"><strong>Personality Profiling</strong></p>
<p>Motivation, management, communications, relationships - focused on yourself or others - are a lot more effective when you understand yourself, and the people you seek to motivate or manage or develop or help. It can also help to unlock the qualities of leadership, motivation, empathy, behaviour and attitudes which provides you with the knowledge to develop self-awareness and also to help others to achieve greater self-awareness and development too, in the workplace and beyond.</p>
<p>There are many different personality and motivational models and theories, and each one offers a different perspective.</p>
<p>At Eden HR we work with you on what it is you want to achieve, by carrying out personality profiling or ability testing. We have a range of personality profiling and ability tests including; 15PQ+, Psycho-geometrics® etc to uncover behaviours that can be identified, managed and enhanced to ensure that you get the right people doing the right job.</p></td>
