Most hiring managers admit to not having any formal interviewing and selection processes in place. They also freely admit that they have mis-hired employees in the past. There is an obvious correlation to be drawn given these two facts.</p>
<p>Having Eden HR to help you will, firstly, give you a significantly greater legal standing should any claims arise out of the recruitment and selection process. Claims surrounding discrimination are the most common in this instance; gender, race, sexual orientation, age, faith and disability are all areas for which candidates can claim there were unfairly treated.</p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly, recruiting the right people can have a positive effect on your business, where as recruiting the wrong people can have a negative impact. The average cost of employing a new member of staff, according to the CIPD resourcing and talent planning survey (2010), is £2,930 rising to £8,333 for senior managers. Clearly given these costs you need to hire the right people first time, every time.</p>
<p>Let us design and implement your recruitment policy and coach you on how to conduct effective interviews and, like all of our clients beforehand, you’ll be surprised at how effective the restructuring of your interviewing can be.</p></td>
