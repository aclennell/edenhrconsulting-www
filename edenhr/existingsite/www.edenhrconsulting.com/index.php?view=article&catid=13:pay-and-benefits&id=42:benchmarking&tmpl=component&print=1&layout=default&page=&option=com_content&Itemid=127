Having a competitor poaching your staff with higher pay can and does happen; knowing a benchmark or ‘market price’ can provide great strength to your reward strategy. Eden can provide independent clarity and validity to your benchmarking and strategy.</p>
<p>Eden HR can assist you by evaluating market pricing and collecting pay data for equivalent jobs to establish their market rate. There are various factors when collecting the data that needs to be taken into account which may affect the proposed market rate such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total package remuneration against basic salary information</li>
<li>Industry differences for the same position</li>
<li>Geographical differences for the same position</li>
<li>Individual employees have their own market value based on unique factors such as talent, expertise and performance </li>
</ul>
<p>Eden takes into account external and internal markets for labour, and both can influence pay rates. The wage in the external market is determined by labour supply and demand. Their importance to individual employers depends on recruitment and retention factors, such as the use of external candidates to fill vacancies, or the ease with which existing and potential employees can find satisfactory work elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is a raft of information concerning reward and ensuring you are rewarding your staff fairly and equitably to ensure the attraction and retention is at a level that you require. If you wish to discuss your issues and requirements further, please feel free to contact us.</p></td>
