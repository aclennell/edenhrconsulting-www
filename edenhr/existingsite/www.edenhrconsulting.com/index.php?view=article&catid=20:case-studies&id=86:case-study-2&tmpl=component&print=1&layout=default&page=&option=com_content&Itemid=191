<p>Our case studies relate to actual issues we have worked on at Eden HR.   In the interest of confidentiality, some details have been changed, and  all of the studies are anonymised.</p>
<p><strong>A Company contacted us following the sudden and unexpected loss of a contract.  The Company contacted us for help as they wanted to make the 2 people who handled that account redundant.</strong></p>
<p>We met with the 2 Directors of the business and explained to them the redundancy process and how candidates for redundancy must be selected.  Two people working on the lost contract must have been put in a <em>‘pool of risk’</em> with all of the other workers doing <em>‘like’</em> work.  Out of the 47 employees we established that 18 of them held ‘like’ positions despite having differing job titles.</p>
<p>Whilst considering this process we helped the Directors analyse the state of the business going forward.  The business serviced exclusively, a sector very badly affected by the recession, and upon analysing its key clients, discovered that they fully expected to lose further work and be subjected to a significant down-turn in trade.</p>
<p>The Directors considered the option of making redundancies as necessary should business be lost.  Eden HR discussed this strategy but also reminded them of the issue of staff morale; if redundancies need to be made, then for the sake of the morale of the workers, it is best to try to only have one round of redundancy, as opposed to having to go through the process several times.</p>
<p>The Company had grown organically over the previous 15 years, from one Director to its peak size of 47 employees and 3 Directors, and this was the first time in its history that the Directors had had cause to look at the structure of the company; who did what, how did they do it, how did that fit with their business strategy.  We helped them to form a proposed new structure, and gave them the opportunity to start with a blank sheet.</p>
<p>Working carefully with the Directors we crafted a new organisational structure, which significantly rationalised the management of the organisation, leaving a much flatter, less hierarchical structure.  From the analysis of the likely future reduction in business, and taking in to account the new structure of the Company, we were able to establish that their head count needed to be reduced by 6.</p>
<p>We guided the company through the restructuring process and managed the 6 redundancies correctly and sensitively.  In addition we provided ‘survivor training’ to those employees not dismissed.</p>
<p><strong><em>This case occurred around 2 years ago and we are still working with the company who have outsourced their HR requirements to us.  The company are doing well; they weathered the recession and are now growing again.</em></strong></p>
