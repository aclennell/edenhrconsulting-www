<p>Our case studies relate to actual issues we have worked on at Eden  HR.  In the interest of confidentiality some details have been changed  and all of the studies are anonymised.</p>
<p><strong>A manufacturing company contacted us for assistance to integrate a complex competency matrix, in to their 5 year corporate strategy plan, which linked to multiple annual corporate projects. It was important to understand whether this was the best approach to take, and whether it was understood within the organisation.</strong></p>
<p>Following discussions with the senior management team and Eden HR, it became apparent that the framework wasn’t actually used, and was not in keeping with the ethos of the organisation. Through our discussions, we were able to establish that the company primarily wanted to drive the business forward by investing in its people.</p>
<p>We proposed a strategy that would help move the people skills forward, within the business timetable of one year, and also a rationalisation of the complex competency framework to ensure that it was readily understandable, usable and useful in the business.</p>
<p>Working in partnership with the senior team, we identified a need to engage the 90 strong workforce in to a mind-set of wanting to learn, develop and grow; which in turn meant they were able to contribute to the overall business strategy and success moving forward.</p>
<p>We undertook the process of providing development assessment centres to determine the talent within the organisation and any potential knowledge gaps. The assessment centres looked at the competencies and personal profiles of each individual, and moved through to providing development solutions that would up-skill individuals within the organisation over a one year development plan.  In order to show commitment, the initial work was with the senior management team and then with individual work teams. We provided the organisation with a schedule of workshops and coaching interventions, that would support the overall strategy of the business whilst ensuring practical, solution-focussed applications, that could be used on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>The senior management team also undertook a programme of 1-2-1 business coaching sessions with their coach on a monthly basis, which enabled them to reinforce the study points learned from the workshops and the day-to-day management of the business.</p>
<p>The ongoing commitment to development for the employees commenced with workshops on how to get the most out of the appraisal process (both managers and staff), followed by a series of bite-sized workshops that tackled the topics of communication, building highly successful teams, understanding emotional intelligence, effective time management, problem solving and decision making skills. All workshops ensured that the tools acquired in the classroom environment were able to cross-over in to the practical application in individual’s day to day roles.</p>
<p>Additional work that is currently being  undertaken to ensure that the line managers continue to develop practical HR knowledge, to be able to effectively manage their staff, assessment centre and interviewing training to help them ensure that they recruit the best candidates and also management skills. <br /><br /><strong><em>The results of this training, development and coaching intervention has shown a noticeable increase in the effectiveness of the front line management approach which is further enhanced and supported by the knowledgeable and well equipped senior management team.</em></strong></p></td>
