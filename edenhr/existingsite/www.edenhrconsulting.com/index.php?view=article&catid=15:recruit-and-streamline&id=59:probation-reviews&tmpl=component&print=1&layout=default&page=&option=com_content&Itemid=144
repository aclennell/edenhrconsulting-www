It is important to regularly review all your staff but more importantly those on probation.</p>
<p>Those members of staff with less than one year’s service have reduced employment rights compared to those with over one year’s service. This does not absolve you of your duties to undertake process correctly, but, the first year is when you are able to dismiss employees far more easily if they are not able or willing to perform to the required standards.</p>
<p>In reviewing your probationary employees you are better able to track and document trends. It is important to recognise exemplary performance but also to deal with under-performance. This will protect you against a possible claim of discrimination if an employee leaves the business during probation.</p>
<p>Reviews may also help you to enhance your induction programme for future.</p>
<p>Eden HR can assist in providing tailored documentation to ensure you treat "probationers" consistently, get the most from them, whilst giving them the opportunity to achieve.  We also can assist with chairing or assisting at performance reviews and end of probation meetings.  If you wish to discuss how we can help you, please feel free to contact one of our Consultants.</p></td>
