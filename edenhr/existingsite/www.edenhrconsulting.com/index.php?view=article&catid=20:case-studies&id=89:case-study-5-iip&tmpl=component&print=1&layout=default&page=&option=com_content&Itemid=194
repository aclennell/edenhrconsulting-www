<p>Our case studies relate to actual issues we have worked on at Eden   HR.  In the interest of confidentiality, some details have been changed   and all of the studies are anonymised.</p>
<p><strong>Eden HR was contacted by service company who had grown rapidly both organically and through acquisition in the previous year.  The company’s Administration Manager had, in conjunction with the Managing Director noticed that had holes in their people policies and practices.</strong></p>
<p>The client company operates in the creative sector and understands that hiring and retaining the best people is key to the organisation’s success.  They also realised that employer brand was highly important in attracting key people and that investing in them was vital to retain them.  With this in mind, the client wanted to become accredited to the Investors in People (IiP) standard.</p>
<p>At our initial meeting we discussed the ‘people point points’ that were affecting the company, and also the desire of the Managing Director to achieve IiP.  We were able to reassure the client that their basic HR was in pretty good shape, and that their fundamental problem was the correct and consistent application of their policies.  In respect of the IiP accreditation, we were able to put together a plan which combined the creation and implementation of some new policies, the consistent application of existing policies and also targeted staff training.</p>
<p>We were able to deliver the projected plan over a period of 9 months, and thus allowing new practices and systems to bed down within the company, and be modified as necessary.  The 9 month period also allowed the company to obtain the best results from on-going training.  Such a time period, with correctly targeted staff development, can really help change behaviour and company culture.  Such a culture shift was necessary to secure true benefit from IiP.</p>
<p><em><strong>With regular project meetings keeping track of progress the organisation successfully achieved IiP status and continues to grow and gain quality market share.</strong></em></p></td>
