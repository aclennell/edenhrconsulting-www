<p><img width="300" height="273" src="http://www.edenhrconsulting.com/images/stories/eden-stick-figures/eden-training.jpg" alt="eden-training" style="float: right;" />Development assessment centres focus on opportunities for work related personal development, as well as to gauge individual and team potential, and help make selections for promotion and succession planning.  Additionally, they can help individual team members to understand the strengths and development needs of their colleagues, and how best to approach them to gain the best results.</p>
<p>These centres include work-related activities and group work, as well as coaching and psychometric assessments. They offer a detailed picture of individual capabilities in relation to the job role and required competencies.</p>
A typical development assessment centre day could consist of the following activities;      
<ul>
<li>An ice breaking session</li>
<li>Psychometric profile - 15FQ+ which focuses on an individuals’ interpersonal skills, thinking style and coping style</li>
<li>Team exercise - which capture an individuals’ ability in areas such as problem solving, team-working, organisational skills, management skills, approach and attitude to others.</li>
<li>Competency based interview - which is tailored around competencies and assesses how people have behaved in the past, to predict the behaviours they would display in future.</li>
<li>Psycho-geometric exercise - build a profile which identifies an individuals’ communication and behavioural style;</li>
<li>Group communication - which can be used in every day working as well as during the appraisal process.  Providing communication skills training to get the most out of your people.</li>
<li>A wash-up session</li>
</ul>
<p>Each development assessment program is tailored to your specific requirements.  The individual assessments used will differ depending on the aims of the Organisation, and they are all results driven to ensure high quality outcomes.</p>
<p>From the day, we can produce an individual report for each delegate, and provide an insightful feedback session focusing on the positives and development needs of the individual.  Each delegate will receive a detailed feedback report which will be presented and discussed with them individually, on a day separate from the development day.  This gives time for both the report to be produced, but also individual reflection on the development.  We also hold a follow up session around six weeks later with each delegate.</p>
<p>At Eden we provide qualified staff accredited by the British Psychological Society (BPS) to undertake these centres.  This is a vital consideration when planning to use psychological tools in terms of understanding and interpreting assessments and also working with products with a high validity rating (independently tested).</p>
<p>In addition, feedback sessions are undertaken by one of our qualified business coaches to enable the delegates to take away the maximum in personal effectiveness.</p>
