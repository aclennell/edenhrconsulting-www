The key is to making sure that you have an appropriate range of policies that are applicable for your business.</p>
<p>There is one policy that you must legally have in place with 5 or more staff, and that is a Health and Safety policy. Grievance and Dismissal policies used to be a legal requirement; however, their legal standing was repealed in April 2009. That said, if an Organisation does not have these policies in place and does not follow the process within them (which is now detailed as the ACAS code of best practice) then any grievance, disciplinary or dismissal could be deemed as unfair at a tribunal. Therefore, Eden suggests that disciplinary and grievance policies together with the Health and Safety policy are the minimum policies that any organisation should have in place. Eden can, of course, provide and implement these minimums, however, we can also provide and implement a whole suite of policies aimed at safeguarding your business.</p>
<p>Going above and beyond the legal minimums is not a requirement in law; however, it has many benefits. Having policies in place before an issue arises can pre-empt any problems. Knowing how you will deal with issues such as maternity/paternity leave, flexible working applications, retirement and dress code to name but a few, will be tremendously effective at setting out what is expected of both the employee and employer if or when such a situation arises.</p>
<p>Many issues that we are called to deal with are on a reactive basis and have arisen because policies and expectations were not clearly defined in the beginning, and quite often lead to grievances. Such grievances can cause disruption in the workplace and goodwill can be lost between the employer and the employee and, on occasions, other employees.</p>
