<p>Our case studies relate to actual issues we have worked on at Eden HR.   In the interest of confidentiality, some details have been changed, and  all of the studies are anonymised.</p>
<p><strong>We were contacted by a small consulting company about a potential redundancy.  The client wanted to make one person redundant as he felt that the employee <em>‘wasn’t working out’</em>.  The employee had been employed by the client for over 12 months; this is important as employees have a higher level of employment rights than he would have than with less than a year’s service.</strong></p>
<p>We explained clearly that redundancy is defined as a <em>‘diminution of work’</em> and him <em>‘not working out’</em> did not fall in to the classification of redundant.  We met with the client and established that the employee, a business development manager, was consistently failing to meet targets, had a high absence rate and also had a history of failing to turn up to client meetings.</p>
<p>We advised the client that we should pursue disciplinary action against the employee.  This was agreed, and Eden undertook the disciplinary hearing with the employee.  During the meeting the employee blamed his lateness on a medical condition, and in respect of failing to turn up to meetings he had simply forgotten them.  He blamed his poor sales performance on the recession.</p>
<p>The outcome of the disciplinary was threefold; firstly we formally asked for the employee’s permission to obtain his medical records concerning the alleged condition.  Secondly, we issued a written warning for failure to turn up to meetings, and thirdly, we implemented a 4 week improvement plan with respect to his sales.</p>
<p>The employee refused his permission for the company to access his medical records.  As we were unable to confirm the medical condition he cited, we could not, in future, consider the alleged condition with regards to absenteeism.</p>
<p>The employee was reviewed weekly by his manager with respect to sales targets and, 4 weeks later, he had still fallen 70% below his sales targets and had also been late and absent on a number of occasions.  The employee was brought in to a disciplinary hearing again, and this time was issued with a final written warning, together with a continuation of his improvement plan.</p>
<p>Following this the employee resigned from the company, and, as we had correctly drafted the company’s contracts of employment, we were able to pay him in lieu of notice, and he left the company the same day.</p>
<p class="Blue"><em><strong>The employee took no litigation action against the company.</strong></em></p>
