<p>Auditing your business for compliance with Health and Safety regulations is essential, after all Officers of the HSE are ‘warranted’, but as mentioned in the header of the Health and Safety section, the whole purpose of Health and Safety legislation is to keep you, and your employees safe and healthy at work.</p>
<p><strong>Services available</strong></p>
<p>All services are tailored to the clients’ specific business needs to assist them in efficiently managing health and safety to keep employees health and safe, and to ensure that work activities to do not present safety risks to other people.  Sensible health and safety management makes good business sense as it prevents accidents and ill-health and ensures that you comply with health and safety legislation.</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Workplace inspections </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>For clients who need reassurance that their safety management systems are working, an inspection from an ex-HSE inspector will give an overview of the health and safety issues that need to be addressed in the workplace to comply with health and safety legislation and prevent injury and ill-health. Inspections can be conducted for a wide range of industries, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Factories (manufacturing, engineering, ceramics, electroplating etc);</li>
<li>Transport (motor vehicle repair, couriers, vehicle assembly etc)</li>
<li>Warehousing;</li>
<li>Offices;</li>
<li>Retail;</li>
<li>Health services (health clinics, care homes, hospitals etc);</li>
<li>Peripatetic services (gardeners, window cleaners, aerial installers etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients are provided with a full prioritised report of findings, explanation of areas that need to be improved, and discussion of cost-effective options to achieve appropriate standards and comply with relevant health and safety legislation. We can also work with you to implement the findings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workplace audit</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An audit includes a workplace inspection, as above, but will also include a more in-depth look at management processes that will assist clients in managing health and safety effectively on an on-going basis.</p>
<p>An HSG 65 compliant audit will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workplace inspection;</li>
<li>Review of existing health and safety management systems, including health and safety policy, control of contractors and staff consultation;</li>
<li>Review of general and specific risk assessments, including manual handling, DSE assessment, noise, workplace transport, fire risks and COSHH or other issues as appropriate to your business;</li>
<li>Review of accident and incident reporting procedures;</li>
<li>Review of health and safety signage, posters, Employers’ Liability Certificate;</li>
<li>Review of training and instructions to staff;</li>
<li>Review of First Aid provision;</li>
</ul>
<p>A full prioritised report of findings, explanation of areas that need to be improved, and discussion of cost-effective options to achieve appropriate standards and comply with relevant health and safety legislation.</p>
<p>Following on from a health and safety audit, Eden HR Consulting can advise you and work with you to implement the audit findings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk Assessments and advice</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Employers have a legal duty to conduct risk assessments and implement the significant findings, and to record these in writing where 5 or more people are employed. Risk assessments should be working documents to assist in the management of health and safety.</p>
<p>Risk assessments can be reviewed or devised for your specific work activities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machinery safety;</li>
<li>Display Screen Equipment;</li>
<li>Work at Height;</li>
<li>Slips and Trips;</li>
<li>Workplace transport;</li>
<li>Electrical safety;</li>
<li>Fire and explosion risks;</li>
<li>Noise;</li>
<li>Manual handling;</li>
<li>Lone Working;</li>
<li>First Aid;</li>
<li>Control of contractors;</li>
<li>Welfare provision for staff e.g. toilets, rest rooms etc;</li>
<li>Specific assessments for young people, pregnant women, disabled workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also give you specific advice tailored to your business on these issues, and work with you to ensure that you are able to effectively manage health and safety and prevent accidents and ill-health.</p>
<p>If you would like more details on how we can help you to manage the above issues, please speak to us today.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>COSHH assessments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is a legal requirement to conduct COSHH assessments for any substances used in the workplace that could be hazardous to health, and to implement the findings to prevent ill-health or injury.</p>
<p>In addition to substances purchased for use in the workplace, biological agents present in the workplace should be assessed where relevant, including for instance, blood-borne viruses associated with needlestick injuries.</p>
<p>We can assist you in reviewing your COSHH assessments to ensure that you are complying with your legal duties, or work with you to assist you in completing your COSHH assessments and devising suitable action plans to control your hazardous substances.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health and Safety Policy and Staff Consultation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We can review your health and safety policy, or work with you to devise a suitable health and safety policy, and advise you on how best to communicate with and consult your staff on health and safety matters. This will ensure that you comply with current health and safety legislation and make the best use of the expertise you already have within your business.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lone Working</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have staff who regularly work alone, either in a fixed workplace, or travelling as part of their work responsibilities?</p>
<p>Are you confident that you have management systems in place to ensure their safety whilst working, and to ensure that help reaches them rapidly if they are in danger or fall ill whilst at work?</p>
<p>The following are true stories that could have been prevented:</p>
<ul>
<li>An estate agent met an unknown client, went missing, and was later found dead;</li>
<li>A security guard had a heart attack, and as no-one checked on him during his shift, he died on duty;</li>
<li>A bank worker fell down a flight of stairs late at night and was unable to summon help;</li>
<li>A health worker was attacked whilst conducting community visits.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can help you to develop effective management systems to ensure that your lone workers are protected whilst at work, and can go home safely at the end of their working day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual handling</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Manual handling should be avoided<strong> </strong>where reasonably practicable<strong>. </strong>It is a legal requirement to conduct manual handling risk assessments for those manual handling activities that cannot be avoided, and this allows you to systematically consider the work task, the load, the environment and individual capabilities and to make any necessary adjustments to prevent injury or ill-health.</p>
<p>Effectively implementing manual handling risk assessments may result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of lifting aids, trolleys or conveyor belts;</li>
<li>Reorganisation of work processes;</li>
<li>Changes to the load;</li>
<li>Changes to delivery times/locations;</li>
<li>Training and revised instructions to staff;</li>
<li>Less back and other musculoskeletal injuries and therefore less absence from work;</li>
<li>More efficient handling of products or goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can advise you on manual handling solutions or conduct risk assessments to help your business to run more efficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machinery safety</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are still too many accidents at work that involve machinery, often resulting in amputations, and these accidents can be easily avoided. Suppliers of machinery for use at work, and those responsible for the workplace have a duty to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent access to a dangerous part of machinery, or</li>
<li>Stop movement of dangerous parts before a person enters the danger zone</li>
</ul>
<p>We can give advice on the safety measures required by law to protect employees, including guarding, safe systems of work for maintenance and clearing blockages, and instruction and training for employees. All types of work equipment can be included, from engineering and manufacturing work through to lifting equipment such as passenger lifts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accident Investigation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Accidents are an expensive cost to your business, in more than just financial terms; they can result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lost work time on the day of the accident;</li>
<li>Sick leave, if the injured person recovers;</li>
<li>Additional administration in dealing with insurers;</li>
<li>Payment of insurance excesses and increased insurance premiums;</li>
<li>Investigation by health and safety enforcing bodies;</li>
<li>Conducting your own investigation;</li>
<li>Additional expense in using temporary labour;</li>
<li>Loss of morale amongst staff;</li>
<li>Bad publicity and loss of customers;</li>
<li>Potential fines (civil claim by the injured person, and fines/investigation costs by HSE).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have had an accident in your workplace, use the skills and experience of an ex- HSE health and safety inspector to conduct an investigation for you and determine the root causes. This will enable you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn from the experience and prevent a recurrence;</li>
<li>satisfy the requirements of HSE inspectors or Environmental Health Officers;</li>
<li>provide details to your insurance company;</li>
<li>demonstrate your commitment to health and safety to your employees and customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients are provided with a full prioritised report of findings, explanation of areas that need to be improved, and discussion of cost-effective options to achieve appropriate standards and comply with relevant health and safety legislation. We can also work with you to implement the findings.</p>
<p>We can also train you in accident investigation techniques so that you can spot trends in minor accidents and near misses and use this experience to prevent a more serious incident.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achieve compliance with Improvement and Prohibition Notices</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you receive a visit from an HSE inspector or an Environmental Health Officer (EHO) they may issue you with formal Notices to improve your health and safety standards. An Improvement Notice will tell you to improve specific working practices within a specified timeframe, and a Prohibition Notice will prevent you from doing a particular work activity until you have introduced a safe way of doing it. Failure to comply with these formal Notices is an offence, and can result in a fine for non-compliance, plus a fine for the original offence.</p>
<p>From April 2012, if a formal Notice is issued by the HSE, this will also cost you approximately £1500 for their time under the new charging regime (at £133 per hour for all visit and administration time), and you will still have the expense of introducing safety measures. All enforcement Notices are also entered onto a Public Register which can be viewed online.</p>
<p>If you have been issued with a formal Notice, use the skills and experience of an ex- HSE health and safety inspector to help you to comply with the requirements laid down in the Notice.</p>
<p>Better still, use our services to improve your health and safety standards before an HSE inspector or EHO visits your premises!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workplace Transport</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Workplace transport is a huge part of most of our working lives, the cause of many serious accidents each year, but largely taken for granted by businesses. Workplace transport includes company cars, lorries and vans, forklift trucks and any other vehicles used for work purposes. Key health and safety issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driver safety;</li>
<li>Loading and unloading deliveries;</li>
<li>Ensuring that vehicles are safe;</li>
<li>Maintenance programmes;</li>
<li>Preventing or properly managing reversing manoeuvres;</li>
<li>Preventing vehicles from overturning;</li>
<li>Preventing falls from vehicles (people and goods);</li>
<li>Safe traffic routes around sites;</li>
<li>Safe parking;</li>
<li>Protecting members of the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can advise you on workplace transport solutions or help you with conducting risk assessments, which will help your business to run more efficiently and prevent accidents involving staff and members of the public, as well as preventing damage to expensive equipment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We can provide training tailored to your business on any of the health and safety issues mentioned in the health and safety section of this website, conducted by our ex-HSE inspector consultant, who has many years’ experience of working with a range of employees and industries and is also a qualified trainer.
