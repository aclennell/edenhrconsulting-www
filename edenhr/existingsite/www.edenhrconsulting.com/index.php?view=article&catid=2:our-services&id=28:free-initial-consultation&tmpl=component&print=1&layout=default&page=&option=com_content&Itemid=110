<p>We like to get to know our customers’ businesses. What do you do, how do you do it, is it meeting your needs and is it legal? This helps us to build up an understanding of your business and about the way you work. That’s why, for our first consultation with you, we will meet you free of charge.</p>
<p>The consultation will normally last between an hour and an hour and a half; you can really get the most out of the meeting by having all of your employment documentation and details ready for us.</p>
<p>When we meet you it’s great to find out about your business. We need to know how the people fit within your business and what type of management style and culture are present within your company. We also need to know what people policies and procedures, staff contracts and the like you have in place. Other things such as handbooks and details of software packages are useful too.</p>
<p>The initial consultation is risk free. We’ll meet, discuss the issues and then provide you with a quote. If you decide to work with us then we’ll be happy to help. If you don’t want to work with us then, obviously, there is no obligation on your part.</p>
<p>Naturally there are some rules; we’re meeting to get to know you and you to know us, so we’ll talk about your business and the things that affect you, and then discuss the ways in which we can help. We won’t provide you specific solutions for issues discussed at this meeting because, after all, that’s what we sell. We will provide you with a detailed follow up and a comprehensive quote for the services we recommend.</p>
<p>If you would like to meet us then please either call us, email us or fill in the contact form on the website. We’d love to hear from you, please do get in touch.</p>
