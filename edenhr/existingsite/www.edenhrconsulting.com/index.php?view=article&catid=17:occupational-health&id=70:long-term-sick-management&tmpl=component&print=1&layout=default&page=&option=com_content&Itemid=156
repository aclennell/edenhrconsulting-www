<p>Should one of your employees be sick for a prolonged period of time, normally in excess of two weeks, then let Eden assist by using techniques and process to manage their absence. We can take on the management of dealing with such cases, ensuring that your business is protected, and that the employee returns to work and productivity as quickly as possible. We can bring a range of different and proven measures to bear on the case to ensure a positive outcome for the business.</p>
<p>Eden's HR Consultants along with Eden's Occupational Health Specialist will manage the long term sickness case of your employee, from attending meetings, letters (gaining permissions necessary), referrals that may be required and return to work programmes.</p>
<p>Return to work programmes are generally used in conjunction long term sick case management. If an employee is absent from work for a prolonged period it can be difficult for them to adjust to returning to a full time role. Often when employees are asked to return on a full time basis immediately after a long period of absence, they go off sick again very shortly which naturally prolongs the process. Using return to work programmes delivers a tangible benefit to your business in assisting long term sick employees, back to work quicker and more productively than without such a programme. In addition, should a claim arise from the long term sick case, then the inclusion of a return to work programme will show that the company has taken its duty of care seriously and has acted reasonably within the law.</p>
<p>If the employee is not fit to undertake their duties, then we will work in conjunction with your Organisation in suggestion and implementation of reasonable adjustments.  If reasonable adjustments cannot be made, as a last resort, Eden HR will assist in advising and implementation of the dismissal of the employee.  Their dismissal would be on the grounds of capability due to ill health.</p></td>
