<p>Occupational health can aid your organisation in a number of different ways. Eden HR Consulting has a qualified Occupational Health Specialist (OHS), who works in conjunction with our HR Consultants and external Occupational Health Physicians (OHP), in order to give the best possible advice and guidance for your business. In the Occupational Health sector, Eden HR can assist your business in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employment medical screening</li>
<li>Long term sick management</li>
<li>Absence management</li>
<li>Return to work programmes</li>
<li>Health surveillance</li>
</ul>
<div style="DISPLAY: none">Under the Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992, amended 2002, an individual DSE Risk assessment should be completed when a new job is commenced and consider the entire work environment, including the work area, work equipment and the physical environment.  Also visual screening of VDU “users” should be provided in conjunction with the employer.<br />
<p> </p>
</div>
<div style="DISPLAY: none">As a woman becomes aware she is pregnant, she should inform her employer. This will enable a suitable and sufficient risk assessment to be completed, taking account of any health risks to the mother and/or the unborn child.<br />
<p> </p>
</div>
<div style="DISPLAY: none">
<p>Full health surveillance may need to include diagnostic tests and specialist medical review. This will involve maintenance of health records, biological monitoring (e.g. in people exposed to lead or mercury), biological effect monitoring (e.g. spirometry for people exposed to allergens).<br />Routine periodic health surveillance -</p>
<p>Due to identified risks to health some employees will need to be monitored on a regular basis e.g. exposure to respiratory and skin sensitisers etc. <br />Due to risks to other employees or the public, routine health surveillance can be of value to identify health problems at an early stage e.g. drivers, food handlers <br />Audiometry – The Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005. If control measures reduce exposure to below the action levels, no extensive health surveillance might be necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
