<p>Our customers use our services for many different reasons, but over the years we have analysed the issues and can say that these mostly fall in to one or more of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They have a specific need for advice</strong> usually with regards to a situation they are encountering in the workplace. This can range from the need to discipline a member of staff to handling bullying or harassment allegations or long-term sickness </li>
<li><strong>They have to update important documentation</strong> to ensure it is fully compliant with ongoing changes in legislation. More often than not, contracts of employment and job descriptions need changing and the staff handbook is out of date </li>
<li><strong>They need ongoing advice and guidance</strong> plus practical hands-on help. They either don't have a person in-house that is responsible for HR, or if they do, the person is not sufficiently qualified to handle every situation. Effectively we act as their internal HR, Training and Health and Safety department </li>
<li><strong>They are planning on making changes in the workplace</strong> such as making redundancies, redeploying staff or more complex organisational changes and they don’t understand their legal obligations as an employer</li>
</ul>
<strong>In addressing these issues we can work with you in a variety of different ways to suit the needs of your business:-</strong> <ol>
<li><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=109:ad-hoc&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=269">Ad-hoc</a></li>
<li>Bronze package</li>
<li>Silver Package</li>
<li>Gold Package</li>
<li>Outsourced</li>
<li>Retained</li>
<li>Projects</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ad-hoc </strong>is simple, no ties, no contracts, no service agreements; you can hire us by the hour so you just pay for what you use. This is really handy if you’ve got a single issue you need us to deal with or occasional advice to support your existing knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Retained</strong> offers a more predictable monthly cost; its better value too. Sign up for a year and you get both a reduction in our rates and the ability to spread your costs*. The thing that makes us different from our competition is that we don’t charge you for something that you don’t use – if you do not have a need one month you can bank the hours!</p>
<p><strong>Projects;</strong> we’ll work with you on a brief, analyse the costs and then provide the service delivery. Great for issues like TUPE, appraisal systems and organisational development.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*subject to terms and conditions</span></p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being responsive to our clients needs. Our advice, and the implementation of that advice, is tailored to you. From a telephone call, conducting ad-hoc meeting (such as disciplinary, grievance and performance appraisal meetings), right through to a regular on-site presence, Eden HR Consulting will work with you to achieve the best results for you and your business.</p>
