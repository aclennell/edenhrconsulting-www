It may seem obvious or even unnecessary to provide a job description but, together with a contract of employment, it is fundamental in being able to effectively manage employees.</p>
<p>We are approached on a very regular basis to deal with under-performing staff, and having a job description is essential in being able to objectively compare what a person is supposed to be doing in their job to what they are actually doing. A job description can also help to prevent these issues from arising in the first place as the employee has details of what is expected clearly set down for them.</p>
<p>A person specification details the qualifications and competencies which the incumbent of a certain job possess. This a great tool when recruiting for new employees as it helps sift CV’s and applications. It can also be used as a defence against any potential discrimination claim brought about as a part of the recruitment process as you have clearly stated the person specification before the recruitment process.</p>
<p>Let us help you design and implement effective job descriptions and person specifications that will empower you to positively manage your work force.</p>
