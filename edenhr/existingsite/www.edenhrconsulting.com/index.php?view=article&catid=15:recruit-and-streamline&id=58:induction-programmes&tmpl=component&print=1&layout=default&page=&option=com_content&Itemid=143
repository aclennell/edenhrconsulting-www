Research shows that a tailor-made company induction can engender goodwill towards the new employer and can increase staff retention.</p>
<p>The purpose of induction is to ensure the effective integration of staff into or across the organisation for the benefit of both parties. According to CIPD guidance, a good induction programme contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orientation (physical) - describing where the facilities are</li>
<li>Orientation (organisational) - showing how the employee fits into the team and how their role fits with the organisation’s strategy and goals</li>
<li>Health and safety information - this is a legal requirement</li>
<li>Explanation of terms and conditions</li>
<li>Details of the organisation's history, its products and services, its culture and values</li>
<li>A clear outline of the job/role requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>By undertaking an induction process with staff, it helps them to understand the Company, to feel part of the team, to understand what is expected of them and deliver against this.  Therefore a robust induction can assist with Company and individual performance.</p>
<p>You are required by law to conduct a Health and Safety induction, however, by incorporating this with a Company induction makes good business sense. Eden HR can guide you through the legal requirements, and develop an induction process tailored to your needs, to ensure you get value back from the time outlay involved in implenting an induction programme.  </p></td>
