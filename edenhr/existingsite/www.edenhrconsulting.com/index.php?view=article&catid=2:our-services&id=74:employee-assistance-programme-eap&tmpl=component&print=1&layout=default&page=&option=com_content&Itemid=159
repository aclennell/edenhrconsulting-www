<p><strong>Reasonable and Nice employer!</strong></p>
<p>With the ever increasing rise in responsibilities and pressures faced by employees at work, there are always going to be times within your organisation when it can all become ‘a bit much’ for your employees, consequently leading to time off through stress, long term sickness and increased absenteeism.</p>
<p>From an employer’s perspective, this is not only detrimental to the organisation through frequently taken and increasingly expensive sick days, yet it can lead to high staff turnover and a risk of potential claims for stress related illnesses.</p>
<p>As an employer, you have a duty of care for the psychological wellbeing of your employees and as such, the utilisation of an Employee Assistance Programme will give you a credible and clear demonstration of your care and commitment to your employees and could provide a wealth of organisational support and benefits including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimise the risk of litigation by the employee</li>
<li>Improve staff morale</li>
<li>Enhanced performance and productivity</li>
<li>Reduced employee and organisational stress</li>
<li>A clear demonstration of your commitment to providing a duty of care to your employees</li>
</ul>
<p>At Eden HR consulting, in conjunction with our partner firm Workforce Wellness, we can provide you with a fully confidential counselling and advisory service to give your employees access to 24hr telephone counselling, face to face counselling, Information services, Management support and online resources. All affiliates abide by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) 'Ethical Framework for Good Practice in Counselling and Psychotherapy' and are subject to Professional Conduct Procedure' therein. All councillors are fully qualified and have a minimum requirement to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be accredited members (or those eligible for accreditation) of one other the following professional bodies: British Psychological Society (BPS), British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) or the Confederation of Scottish Counselling Agencies (COSCA)</li>
<li>A Masters Degree, Post Graduate Diploma level or recognised equivalent qualification or experience</li>
<li>A minimum of 3 years post-qualification counselling experience</li>
<li>At least 500 hours supervised counselling practice </li>
</ul>
<p>All Employee Assistance Programmes can be tailored and constructed to suit your organisation and your employee’s needs.</p>
<p>An employee assistance programme is a programme contracted to a third party specialist organisation that helps employees and members of their household (usually) to manage issues that could adversely impact their work and personal lives. EAP counsellors typically provide assessment, support, and if needed, referrals to additional resources. These programs are becoming increasingly more common in today's workplaces.</p>
<p>Studies indicate that offering EAPs may result in various benefits for employers, including reduced turnover and absenteeism, and higher employee productivity and morale.</p>
<p>The broad array of services provided to employers by today's EAPs make a good business case for external programs. External EAPs can provide more than just psychological counselling through the integration of a host of "work/life" resources. These kinds of resources can help employees wrestling with the associated demands of starting a family, dealing with personal finances, legal problems or the stresses of being a working caregiver with ageing parents. A full-service, integrated external EAP can provide all these services through one single, free phone number that is accessible 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.</p>
<p>Let Eden HR assist you to implement an EAP programme with one of our trusted providers.</p></td>
