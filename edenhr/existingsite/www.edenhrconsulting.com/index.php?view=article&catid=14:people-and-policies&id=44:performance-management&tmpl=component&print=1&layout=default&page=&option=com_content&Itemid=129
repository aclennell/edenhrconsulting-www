Performance management can focus on the performance of an organisation, a department, employee, or even the processes to build a product or service, as well as many other areas.”</em></p>
<p>In creating a Company where performance is managed effectively, performance management policies and practices should be both strategic and integrated. They should reflect long term goals and dealing with broader issues. They should also be integrated across various aspects of the business and implemented within departments, teams and individuals.</p>
<p>Performance management looks to improve performance, not only to an acceptable level or standard, but goes beyond this, as an effort for a continued improvement approach which is achieved through the development of individuals.</p>
<p>Often performance can be enhanced or negatively affected by an employee’s behaviour. Ensuring that individuals are encouraged to behave in a way that allows and fosters better working relationships is of the upmost importance.</p>
<p>People who are under-performing can drag a team, or indeed a whole organisation down. It’s important to deal with these issues as and when they arise. Dealing with small issues in a timely manner is far more effective and much less risky for the organisation than letting a situation fester and deteriorate.</p>
<p>Disciplinary procedures are primarily used to help and encourage improvement amongst staff, but maybe needed as a tool to ensure performance issues are addressed and formally logged. If however, improvement is not satisfactory, then performance management, coupled with disciplinaries procedures and/or dismissal, may be unfortunately required after a series of no improvement.</p>
<p>Policies, practices and culture can increase performance levels. This can be achieved through implementing practices such as setting expectations, monitoring and managing underperformance through to encouraging great performance and rewarding these.</p>
