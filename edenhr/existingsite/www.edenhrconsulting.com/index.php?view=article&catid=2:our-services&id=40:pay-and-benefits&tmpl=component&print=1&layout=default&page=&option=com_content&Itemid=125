<p>We all need to be paid and we need to pay our employees. Pay and benefits are an emotive subject. High pay does not necessarily guarantee a motivated and productive work force. Low pay is not necessarily an indicator of poor quality staff</p>
<p>Traditionally the aims of <strong>Pay and Benefits</strong>, (or <strong>‘Reward’</strong> as it’s often now referred to) were to attract, retain and motivate employees. The salary attracted staff, benefits kept them and bonuses motivated them. This model is now somewhat outdated, and the current thinking, is that the distinct categorisations above have broken down, and that people are no longer simply attracted retained and motivated by cash, an annual bonus and a company car.</p>
<p>People are engaged by a wide range of both financial and non-financial remuneration packages and these can change over a person’s working life depending on their personal circumstances at the time.</p>
<p>The different reward motivators or attractions could differ depending on the individual. One employee may be attracted by travel, training and secondment opportunities, whereas another may be engaged by maternity / paternity benefits, flexible working arrangements and a good pension. Of course, this is just an example; finding out what your employees want and being able to offer incentives to them is crucial in recruiting, retaining and motivating the best staff to support your business.</p>
<p>By considering what attracts, retains and motives your workforce, you are then able to consider how best to offer to remunerate them. This can be put together to form a <strong>Reward Strategy.</strong> Eden HR can assist your organisation by providing statistical research data and also conducting employee surveys in order to create a reward strategy for you that will create the closest match to the needs of the business and those of your employees.</p>
<p>‘It is important to establish a reward strategy which clearly articulates the aims of the various reward elements, integrates them in a coherent way and tells employees what they can expect to receive and why. This strategy needs to be written, communicated and understood throughout the organisation. It is the yardstick by which reward elements are measured and evaluated and manages the expectations of all employees. Without an articulated reward strategy, the various elements will at best seem like individual initiatives and at worse employees will be left to form their own opinions about what the organisation is trying to achieve.’ (Chartered Institute of Personnel &amp; Development March 2010)</p>
<p>Other areas that Eden can help are on issues such as the <strong>National Minimum Wage</strong> (NMW), <strong>Equal Pay, Reward Surveys, Job Evaluation, Benchmarking, Pay Banding, Flexible Benefits</strong> and the like.</p>
<p>Some elements worth further explanation on this website are <strong>Equal Pay</strong> and <strong>Benchmarking. </strong></p></td>
