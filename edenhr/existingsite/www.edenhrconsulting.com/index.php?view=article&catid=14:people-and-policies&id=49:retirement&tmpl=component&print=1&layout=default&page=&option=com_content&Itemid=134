Currently according to a judgement handed down by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in March 2009 you can force people to retire on age reasons alone.</p>
<p>There is significant pressure mounting for the legislation surrounding this area to be changed and, with the election of a new government, this may well be changed in the not too distant future to eradicating compulsory retirement age all together.....watch this space.</p>
<p>This is a policy area which we expect to change; however, current rules apply and the retirement legal process needs to be handled correctly. If mishandled, an employee can claim unfair dismissal and may well win at an employment tribunal.</p>
<p>Positive retirement and succession planning will also have a positive effect on your workforce; Showing that you are well managed and care for your employees, goes a long way to creating a positive environment resulting in better productivity and fewer people issues.</p>
<p>From handling retirement process correctly, you can manage the knowledge gap as a result of a person retiring, keeping a retiree employed for a fixed period after their retirement age, making the transition easier for you and your employee through scaling down of hours over a period of time before retirement etc.  All of these options are neccessary to think about to ensure that your business is being effective, promoting good will amongst staff and protecting you against tribunal cases.</p></td>
