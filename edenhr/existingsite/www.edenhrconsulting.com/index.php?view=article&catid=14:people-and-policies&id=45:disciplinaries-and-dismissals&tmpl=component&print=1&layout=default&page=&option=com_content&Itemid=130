However, as long as you follow the legally recognised process and treat the employee fairly and consistently against other staff, conducting a disciplinary or dismissal may be necessary to ensure a level of conduct or performance is adhered to by your staff and existing staff if applicable.</p>
<p>It may be worth considering the cost to your business of not dealing with issues rather than the opposite. Often there is a natural tendency to stay away from contentious issues and potential disputes, but the best option is to deal with it. Eden HR can take the stress away from dealing with disciplinaries and dismissals and ensure that you are following correct process, which in turn protects your business. Our assistance can range from the writing of letters to advice on/conducting and/or chairing the disciplinary meeting on your behalf.</p>
<p>Most people think of disciplinary proceedings as arising from a very serious single incident, such as violence or theft for instance. In reality this is rarely the case, and the disciplinary process is used for far more mundane issues, such as poor attendance etc. Disciplinary procedures are primarily used to help and encourage improvement amongst staff, and can have a positive outcome once issues are addressed. If however, improvement is not satisfactory, then performance management coupled with further disciplinaries and/or dismissal may be unfortunately required</p>
<p>Eden HR Consulting can help to deliver a professional and impartial approach to such proceedings, usually resulting in far greater employee acceptance of the situation and also delivering measurable actions for improvement to the employees where necessary.</p></td>
