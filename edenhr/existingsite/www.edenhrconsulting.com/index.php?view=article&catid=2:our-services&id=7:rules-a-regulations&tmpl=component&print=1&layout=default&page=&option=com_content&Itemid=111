<p><strong>Confused about</strong> <strong>Employment Law and are you protected?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>52% of UK businesses are SMEs* with little or no internal HR function </li>
<li>90% of SME* directors are unaware of some of the most basic employment rights </li>
<li>Tribunals cost UK businesses £220m per year </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*SME’S - small to medium sized enterprises</span></p>
<p>If 90% of SME directors are unaware of the most basic employment rights, then 90% of SMEs could be putting themselves at risk of breaking the law and being taken to employee tribunal.</p>
<p><strong>Are you at risk?</strong></p>
<p>Our employment law support is backed up by close links with a leading regional law firm, to whom referrals can be made in appropriate situations. Our work as HR Consultants has some overlap with services provided by solicitors, but we are mainly concerned with avoiding legal problems through sound practices and policies. We also provide HR solutions which will not be covered by solicitors, for example; appraisal systems, recruitment practices and of course conducting disciplinaries, dismissals and redundancies where necessary.</p>
<p>There are some startling facts and figures that make frightening reading for employers; statistics about the cost of tribunals, the average pay-out at tribunal, the numbers of employees lodging complaints with the Employment Tribunal service, the cost of absences and many more.  We don’t want to bombard our clients with statistics to frighten them in to using us, and besides, to make people management effective you need to believe that good management practices have a place in your business.  Knowledge is nothing unless you use it and use it well.</p>
<p>Employment law is designed to be fair and equitable to both parties.  Legislation and precedence have come together over many years to form the system we have at present.  Following good management practice, with sound implementation and working within the existing legal framework is straight forward good business sense.  We can help you devise and implement the appropriate policies, procedures and management practices within your business to deliver noticeable results.</p>
<p> That said, you do need to know how to navigate the current system and that’s what we excel in.  We can help in so many ways.  If you look under the "Our Services" tab you will be able to read, in depth more about the help we can provide.  Our aim is to support you in running your business, and to that end we work to help integrate good people management in to your business both at a strategic and a practical level.</p>
<p>We look at integrated processes, policies and practices. For instance, making a clear link between employment terms and conditions, contractual letters, staff handbooks and policies, whilst also interconnecting with individual company values and practices.</p>
<p>There are many areas in employment legislation that apply to all sizes of business, from one employee to one thousand, for example, written particulars of employment. Your time is valuable, and it is a common saying that a director’s time is mostly spent on people issues. Outsourcing your HR requirements frees up your time, so that you can concentrate on what you do best – running your business! Eden HR Consulting can not only help you to do this, but can also save you money (especially if you currently refer to your solicitor). Eden HR Consulting can help you become an employer of choice attracting and retaining the best staff whilst also being viewed positively by your customers.</p>
<p>Employment law is always changing. Let Eden HR Consulting deal with the red tape. We’ll keep you on the right side of the law while you concentrate on running and growing your business.</p></td>
