<p><img height="225" width="300" src="http://www.edenhrconsulting.com/images/stories/eden-stick-figures/eden-rules-regulations.jpg" alt="eden-rules-regulations" style="float: right;" />There are a myriad of different policies and procedures that companies may adopt, some very general and some very specific. The one thing that is certain is that you need to establish a good framework of generalist policies in order to help with the day-to-day running of your business, and also to protect you from claims.</p>
<p>Policies set out clearly and unambiguously what is expected of both the employee and employer in a given situation; for example maternity, disciplinary, retirement and the like. If you have these policies in place, and follow them fairly and equitably, then you are both engaging with your workforce and also significantly reducing potential claims, particularly ones related to discrimination which carry uncapped fines at Tribunal.</p>
<p>Policies are not documents to be filed and left on a shelf; rather they are working documents which help to direct your managers and staff in given situations. A good policy is one that is well considered, actively used and also regularly reviewed to ensure it is fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Eden HR Consulting can assist you in creating all sorts of different policies, not just those legally required and the traditional ones you may expect from HR. Our policies can be adapted and bespoke to your business, and so they will accommodate (where legal) your existing practices, and enable you to incorporate new, more business focused ways of working.</p></td>
