<p>Employment medical screening is a great way of ensuring your employees are fit to work.  Medical screening can be undertaken before an employee actually starts work for you, and also for monitoring employees throughout employment.  Employment medical screening should be undertaken only after offer and acceptance of employment has been made and with the agreement of the employee.  Employment medical screening ensures that any pre-existing medical conditions are picked up prior to employment commencing.  This work can be useful for three reasons:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>You make reasonable adjustments (if required) to meet your legal requirements, </li>
<li>You are in a position to refer the employee to an independent Occupational Health Physician to assess the individuals fitness to undertake the position </li>
<li>You can more robustly defend any claims of a work related injury such as a bad back, stress or mental health issues for existing conditions. Knowledge of such conditions in advance can give you a head start in supporting and managing the employee in the workplace, as well as preventing a claim for pre-existing medical complaints that the employee had before commencing work with your Company.</li>
