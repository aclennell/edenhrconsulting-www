At Eden HR, we aim to develop you and your staff; we can train, educate, coach, mentor, guide and assist you and your team to reach the standards your business strives for.</p>
<p>Learning and development encompasses a wide spectrum of different activities which enables you to learn something new, build on your existing skill set or allow you to take something you have learnt way-back and bring it up-to-date with a different, fresher way of thinking.</p>
<p>In order to get the best results from learning and development, you really need to consider it from a strategic point of view. Attending a training course or development workshop to learn something new or develop on existing skills is all well and good, but why are you doing it? Establishing the need for learning, training and development and then fitting it to a skills gap delivers far more effective results than undertaking training that is not aligned with the overall business need and therefore cannot be measured.</p>
<p>Learning and development are key aspects of sustained organisational performance, not just HR tools, and creating an effective learning strategy has never been more crucial than in times of constrained finance, restructuring and also potential high growth sectors.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows just how vital learning and development is within the framework of a successful business.</p>
