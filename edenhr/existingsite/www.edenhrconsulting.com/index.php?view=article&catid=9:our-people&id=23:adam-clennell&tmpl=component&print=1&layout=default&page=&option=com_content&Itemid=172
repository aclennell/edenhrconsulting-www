Adam also works on individual projects and has worked closely with a number of our clients on individual projects. He has, on occassion, been embedded within a Client's Organisation acting as an interim HR manager. Adam works very strategically and his business focus is a key strength, valued by our clients.</p>

He worked for some of the major UK contractors such as Costain, Balfour Beatty, Skanska and Mowlem. Adam’s role as a Civil Engineer kept him focused on successful project management, planning, budgetary management and of course health and safety. Following a successful career in Construction, Adam decided to ‘hang up his boots’ and join Eden as the company grew and to pursue his interest in effective business and people management.</p>

Before that he studied his HNC at the University of Derby where he received two prizes for his work, the Balfour Beatty prize and the Thomas Telford Cup.

<p><strong>Recommendations for Adam</strong></p>
<p><em>“Adam and I first worked together on a project for a mutual client. His previous experience in management in industry gives him a unique insight into the challenges facing employers 'at the coalface' and he translates this into a well-informed and pragmatic approach to HR problem-solving. He can be robust when necessary but is also aware of the importance of handling tricky situations sensitively.”</em></p>
