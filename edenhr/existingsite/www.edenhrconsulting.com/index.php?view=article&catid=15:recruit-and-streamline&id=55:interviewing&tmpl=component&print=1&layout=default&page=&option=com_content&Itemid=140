<p>Do you really know how to interview? Do you know what questions to ask? Indeed, what questions you can ask and ones that you cannot?</p>
<p>Interviews are very widely used in the selection process. There is a range of tools which may be used to distinguish between candidates, but interviews remain the most commonly used in the selection process which is expected by both the candidates and managers. This is because as well as providing information to predict performance, interviewing also gives an opportunity for the interviewer and interviewee to meet face to face and exchange information.</p>
<p>Remember, an interview is so you can choose who will work in your organisation. The cost of getting interviewing wrong can have a dramatic effect on your business.</p>
<p>Having Eden HR to help you will firstly, give you a greater legal standing should any claims arise out of the recruitment and selection process. Claims surrounding discrimination are the most common in this instance; gender, race, sexual orientation, age, faith and disability are all areas for which candidates can claim that they were unfairly treated.</p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly, recruiting the right people can have a positive effect on your business, where as recruiting the wrong people can have a negative impact. The average cost of employing a new member of staff, according to the CIPD resourcing and talent planning survey 2010, is £2,930 rising to £8,333 for senior managers. Clearly given these costs, you need to hire the right people, first time, every time.</p>
<p>We can also train, coach and mentor your staff who conduct interviews to help them make better, more informed choices when hiring new staff.</p>
