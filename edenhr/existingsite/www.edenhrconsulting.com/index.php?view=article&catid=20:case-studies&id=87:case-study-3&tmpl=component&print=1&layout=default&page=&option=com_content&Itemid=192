<p>Our case studies relate to actual issues we have worked on at Eden HR.  In the interest of confidentiality, some details have been changed and all of the studies are anonymised.</p>
<p><strong>A Company contact Eden HR after receiving an ET1.  An ET1 is the form that an employee (or ex-employee) fills out and submits to the Employment Tribunals Service to lodge a claim.  In this instance the ex-employee was claiming unfair dismissal.</strong></p>
<p>We met with the Managing Director of the company and established that the employee had been dismissed following the discovery of having been having sexual intercourse with a colleague in the workplace.  The Company invited both employees in to follow disciplinary procedures, one employee went sick with stress and the case against that employee was dropped and no further action was taken.  The other employee attended the disciplinary meeting and was then dismissed for gross misconduct.</p>
<p>The ex-employee’s ET1 did not state sexual discrimination, and, when speaking to the client it was obvious that there was no intent to discriminate; the company’s actions stemmed from being unsure how to deal with the employee who was citing stress and so was not disciplined.  However, from a legal perspective, the company’s actions were clearly discriminatory.</p>
<p>We advised the client to attempt to settle with the ex-employee, to prevent the case escalating to an employment tribunal.  We advised the client on the process and agreed acceptable sums to offer for settlement.  Eden HR contacted the ex-employee as a neutral third party and made an offer of settlement giving a date for settlement; this was followed up in writing.  The ex-employee refused the offer settlement and so, in conjunction with partner solicitors, we drafted an ET3 (a response form submitted to the Employment Tribunals Service by the defendant).  The ET3 was robust and cited that the claimant was entirely responsible for their own dismissal due to their unacceptable conduct.</p>
<p>The week after the ET3 was submitted to the Tribunal we were contacted by the ex-employee stating that they now wanted to take the compromise agreement.  As the deadline for our previous offer had passed and the client had incurred cost in the preparation of the ET3 we submitted a revised offer to the ex-employee which was some £2,000 less than the original offer; this offer reflected the costs incurred in preparing the ET3.  The employee accepted this and duly signed a compromise agreement the following day.<span class="Blue"><em><br /></em></span></p>
<p class="Blue"><strong><em>From a difficult situation we were able to manage the process for the client and settled the claim for less than £5,000; this sum was some £7,000 less than the client had originally been prepared to settle for.</em></strong></p>
