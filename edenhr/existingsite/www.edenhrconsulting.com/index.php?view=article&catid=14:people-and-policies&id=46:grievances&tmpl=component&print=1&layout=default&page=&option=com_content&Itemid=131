<p>As an employer, you have a duty of care over the health safety and well being of your employees, and this extends to their whole wellbeing and that includes their mental as well as physical health. It is both advisable and desirable to actively look for such issues in your workplace as grievances could to cause significant disruption in the workplace.</p>
<p>Disruption quite simply costs money and loss of productivity, good will and management time in resolving such issues. If your workforce know and trust that you will work to resolve any problems that you are much more likely to have fewer grievance issues.</p>
<p>When grievances arise they need to be handled in a timely manner, and in accordance with the ACAS code of practice. Eden HR Consulting can help deliver a professional and impartial approach to such proceedings, usually resulting in far greater employee acceptance of the situation and also delivering measurable actions for improvement to the employees where necessary.</p>
<p>The key benefit to smaller businesses is that we have the expertise and manpower to carry our investigations and hearings by different individuals; a key requirement of the ACAS code of practice.</p>
<p>Talk to us to find out how we can help to meet both your legal obligations and to minimise disruption, and therefore maximise productivity.</p></td>
