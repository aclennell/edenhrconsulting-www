<p><img height="185" width="300" src="http://www.edenhrconsulting.com/images/stories/eden-stick-figures/eden-recruit.jpg" alt="eden-recruit" style="float: right;" />When people have had their employment terminated, be it because of redundancy, ill-health, retirement and the like, the company may wish to consider assisting their former employees to come to terms with their departure from the Organisation.</p>
<p>Outplacement coaching and CV development can be provided as a structured programme or on a piecemeal basis, and can greatly help those leaving the Organisation to gain future employment and leave with a more positive image of the situation.</p>
<p>Most importantly from the Organisation’s point of view, those that remain within the company tend to form a higher opinion of the Organisation. It shows they care and value their staff and, in times or turmoil especially during and following redundancies, it is important to ensure the remaining staff are committed and loyal toward the company.</p>
<p><strong>Retaining and motivating the high quality staff that remain in the Organisation is vital if it is to successfully navigate past difficult times.</strong></p>
<p>Eden HR Consulting can provide outplacement support services in various forms – groups (for general advice and guidance) and on an individual 1-1 basis.  Typically outplacement will comprise of some/all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coaching</li>
<li>CV preparation and refinement </li>
<li>Mock interviewing and feedback </li>
<li>Mock Testing (ability) </li>
<li>Outplacement advice, approaching suitable companies, target marketing CV </li>
<li>Personality profiling to identify professions suited to and strengths to be transferred to CV </li>
<li>Review following real interviews and development of interview skills </li>
<li>Assessment of mock presentation, feedback and development (particularly suited to Sales People) </li>
</ul>
<p>At Eden HR, we are flexible in our approach to enable us to meet your needs.  With this in mind we have a number of ways to offer outplacement to your staff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer a “bank system” for outplacement.  In explanation, this is where you can send a list of names, contact details and number of hours allocated to individuals for outplacement.  Eden HR  informs you, the Company, on what hours have been spent by individuals. With this in mind they can choose which forms of outplacement to use with their hours to suit their needs</li>
<li>A tailored outplacement service offering to individuals based on their position, background and management level</li>
<li>A standard service with CV development and guidance</li>
<li>An extension of the “bank system” whereby the Company purchases a number of hours for each individual, however some will inevitably not require as many hours and some may require more.  Once a person has found a position, their unused hours go into the bank for individuals to utilise who have exhausted their allocated allowance.  This enable the Company to budget accordingly.</li>
<li>A group training and guidance session giving generic tips and guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to us and we can discuss with you what outplacement coaching and CV development involves, and the benefits to your departing staff and to your Organisation as a whole.</p></td>
